                What is Judo?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Judo is a martial art, founded by Jigoro Kano in the late 19th century, developed out of his experience with several styles of jujutsu. Unlike Karate, it is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling">grappling</a>, as opposed to striking, martial art. It focuses primarily in the knowledge of 'throws', though the study of ground techniques (<i>newaza</i>), such as pinning, strangulation, and arm and shoulder locks is also prominent.<br />
                <br />
                Judo and its offshoots have become the most practiced martial art in the world. This is because there is an emphasis on live, near-full-speed sparring (<i>randori</i>), as well as a focus on practicing techniques that, while able to inflict harm, are able to be practiced safely without harming one's opponent. Realistic practice means realistic and usable knowledge. An atmosphere of mutual well being and respect means being well enough to study for a lifetime.<br />
                <br />
                Judo means "gentle way" or "way of pliancy," which refers to the fact that it is the study, ultimately, of flowing with the force of your opponent, as opposed to trying to meet it head on with strength. While easy to understand in theory, it is a skill that takes a great deal of time to apply effectively in <i>randori</i>. Once grasped, however, the smaller, weaker individual is very effectively able to throw the larger opponent. This is the foundation of Judo.<br />
                <br />
                Today, Judo is an Olympic sport, and has spread to all corners of the globe. Students of Judo created at least two other popular martial arts, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu & Sambo. The techniques of Judo have been widely integrated into practically all other grappling curriculums around the world.

                Kokoro
              </h2>
              <p>
                Founded in 2010 by friends who just wanted to have some people to train with, Kokoro has evolved into a group of schools teaching all age groups. Hundreds of students have come and gone, and we now show up (and do well!) regularly at competitions in our region. We have kept our original focus of just being friends that want to do Judo together; as such, we're a non-profit that focuses on building up practice partners, with an emphasis on being affordable and growing--not profits.
                <br /><br />
                We started in the lobby of a Salvation Army location. We outgrew that, and started taking up their gymnasium part time. And then full time. Moving yet again, we signed a deal with Austin Parks & Recreation, and we now have three classes a week at Givens Recreation Center, with plans to expand to other Parks & Rec locations in the future.
                <br /><br />
                Our after school kids program has grown as well, and is thriving.
                <br /><br />
                Other future plans for us include running our own tournaments, and hosting seminars by high level judoka. We don't have a single instructor; instead, a range of black belts teach at different times. When present, we allow visiting high level international competitors to lead the class. We've had near-olympic caliber Judoka from Israel and Romania teach for extended periods of time.
                <br /><br />
