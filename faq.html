				Kokoro FAQ
			</h2>
			<ol style="text-align:left">
				<li>
					<strong>Do I need a judo uniform (gi) to try judo?</strong>
					<br />
					New students do not need a uniform. Just wear a t-shirt and exercise shorts, expect to sweat. It’s a good idea to bring a towel and water bottle.
				</li>
				<br />
				<li>
					<strong>Do I need to do anything else before my first class?</strong>
					<br />
					You will need to sign a release with Kororo prior to stepping on the mat (this is the same as with any commercial gym you visit). If you are not 18, a parent or guardian will need to sign the release.
				</li>
				<br />
				<li>
					<strong>How old do I need to be to participate?</strong>
					<br />
					Although we can accommodate students of all ages (we have some after-school programs at certain area middle schools) our current student population is primarily adults and teens.
				</li>
				<br />
				<li>
					<strong>What is the class like?</strong>
					<br />
					No two classes are the same, generally our practice begins with warm-up exercises and stretches to prepare the body for judo, various skill building drills for the majority of practice accompanied by coaching from the black belts. The last part of class consists of “Randori” (practice fighting). Randori can take multiple forms. New members do not participate in Randori (unless they have prior judo or jujitsu experience).   
				</li>
				<br />
				<li>
					<strong>What’s the first thing I will learn?</strong>
					<br />
					The first priority with new students is to teach them how to fall. As judo starts in a “stand-up” position and uses throws and sweeps to take an opponent to the mat, it is important that students learn how to fall.   
				</li>
				<br />
				<li>
					<strong>Is Kokoro a business?</strong>
					<br />
					No, Kokoro is a non-profit organization dedicated to the teaching of judo, that is why our mat fees are affordable by everyone.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<p style="font-size:12px">
				Kokoro is a diverse group, we welcome anyone who wishes to participate and learn judo, we look forward to meeting you and helping you on your exploration of the martial arts.
