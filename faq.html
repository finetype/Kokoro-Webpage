				Kokoro FAQ
			</h2>
			<p>
				Kokoro is a diverse group, we welcome anyone who wishes to participate and learn judo, we look forward to meeting you and helping you on your exploration of the martial arts.

				<li>
					<strong>Do I need a judo uniform (gi) to try judo?</strong>
					<br />
					You are not expected to show up wearing a uniform when you walk in. Just wear a t-shirt and exercise shorts, expect to sweat. It’s a good idea to bring a towel and water bottle. Eventually, though, you'll want to purchase one if you continue studying. 
				</li>
				<br />
				<li>
					<strong>Can I wear my BJJ gi? Even if it has patches?</strong>
					<br />
					That's fine, we're not picky. :)
				</li>
				<br />
				<li>
					<strong>Do I need to do anything else before my first class?</strong>
					<br />
					You will need to sign a release with Kororo prior to stepping on the mat (this is the same as with any commercial gym you visit). If you are not 18, a parent or guardian will need to sign the release.
				</li>
				<br />
				<li>
					<strong>How old do I need to be to participate?</strong>
					<br />
					At Givens, our current student population is primarily adults and teens. We do have other satelite locations where after-school kids classes are held, however.
				</li>
				<br />
				<li>
					<strong>What is the class like?</strong>
					<br />
					No two classes are the same, generally our practice begins with warm-up exercises and stretches to prepare the body for judo, various skill building drills for the majority of practice accompanied by coaching from the black belts. The last part of class consists of “Randori” (practice fighting). Randori can take multiple forms. New members do not participate in Randori (unless they have prior judo or jujitsu experience).
				</li>
				<br />
				<li>
					<strong>What’s the first thing I will learn?</strong>
					<br />
					The first priority with new students is to teach them how to fall. As judo starts in a “stand-up” position and uses throws and sweeps to take an opponent to the mat, it is important that students learn how to fall safely. Arguably, this is the most helpful skill gained from Judo; most people will never end up in a fight, but most people will fall at some point. :)
				</li>
				<br />
				<li>
					<strong>Is Kokoro a business?</strong>
					<br />
					No, Kokoro is a non-profit organization dedicated to the teaching of judo, that is why our mat fees are affordable by everyone. Our goal is to have fun, win some competitions, and make Judo more popular in the US.
