            <p> <strong>Established in 2010,</strong> Kokoro Judo Club is dedicated to teaching Kodokan Judo to folks age 7-70 so they can be healthier, happier and safer. We're a community based club focusing on both competition technique and general wellness classes for beginners. We're officially sanctioned by USA Judo with a certified coaching staff. This is a group to gather judoka and all people interested in growing Judo in Austin and Central Texas.

            <p><strong>We have members from casual to competitive.</strong> We don't have one single Sensei; instead, we have several black belts of various seniority who lead the group. It is not uncommon for us to have a visiting competitor from a foreign country visit and teach for a while. Class sizes range greatly, and we try to have members participate in several regional competitions in the San Antonio/Dallas/Houston triangle (and beyond, at times!) every year. Someday soon, we plan on running tournaments of our own.</p>
