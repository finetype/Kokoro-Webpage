        <p style="margin-top:20px;"> Established in 2010, Kokoro Judo Club. A Judo club dedicated to teaching Kodokan Judo to folks age 7-70 so they can be healthier, happier and safer. Kokoro Judo is a community based club focusing on both Competition technique and general wellness classes for beginners. An officially sanctioned club by USA Judo with a certified Coaching staff. This is a group to gather judoka and all people interested in reestablishing and growing Sport Judo in Austin and Central Texas. One of our goals is to sponsor a Judo Tournament for all of Austin youth and Judoka. 
        <br /><br />
        We have members from casual to competitive. We don't have one single Sensei; instead, we have several black belts of various seniority who lead the group. It is not uncommon for us to have a visiting competitor from a foreign country visit and teach for a while. Class sizes range greatly, and we try to have members participate in several regional competitions in the San Antonio/Dallas/Houston triangle (and beyond, at times!) every year. </p>
