1. pictures/video situation

	-chronological order.
	-doesn't have to be everything, just highlights.

2. jumbotron
	-slide/fastscroll...: http://untame.net/2013/04/how-to-integrate-simple-parallax-with-twitter-bootstrap/
	-fade in?: index.js
	-maybe edit again, have the text be wide across; maybe be more centered?
	-could create several jumbotron images, have different ones show up at different times... perhaps overkill... 
	-FONT SITUATION. NEED BETTER FONTS.
