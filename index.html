                What is Judo?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Judo is a martial art, founded by Jigoro Kano in the late 19th century, developed out of his experience with several styles of jujutsu. Unlike Karate, it is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling">grappling</a>, as opposed to striking, martial art. It focuses primarily in the knowledge of 'throws', though the study of ground techniques (<i>newaza</i>), such as pinning, strangulation, and arm and shoulder locks is also prominent.<br />
                <br />
                Judo and its derivatives has become the most practiced martial art in the world. This is because there is an emphasis on live, near-full-speed sparring (<i>randori</i>), as well as an emphasis on practicing techniques that, while able to inflict harm, is able to be practiced safely without harming your opponent. <br />
                <br />
                Today, Judo is an Olympic sport, and has spread far and wide. Students of Judo created at least two other popular martial arts, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu & Sambo. The techniques of Judo have also been widely integrated into practically all other grappling curriculums around the world.

                Kokoro
              </h2>
              <p>
                <br />
                Founded in 2010 between some friends who just wanted to have some people to train with, Kokoro has evolved into a group of schools teaching all age groups. Hundreds of students have come and gone, and we now show up (and do well!) regularly at competitions in our region. We have kept our original focus of just being friends that want to do Judo together; as such, we're a non-profit that focuses on building up practice partners, with an emphasis on being affordable and growing, not on making a profit.
                <br /><br />
                We started in the lobby of a Salvation Army location. We outgrew that, and started taking up the gymnasium part time. And then full time. Most recently, we signed a deal with Austin Parks & Recreation, and we now have three classes a week at Givens Recreation Center, with plans to expand to other Parks & Rec locations in the future.
                <br /><br />
                Our after school kids program has grown enormously as well, and is thriving.
                <br /><br />
                Other future plans for us include running our own tournaments, and hosting seminars by high level judoka.
                <br /><br />
